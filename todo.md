# To Do

#### Aggregate Function:

[] * group_by

[x] * sum

[x] * average
    for average, have a insights menu that shows account stats like average balance, amount of accounts, amount of employees(count function)

[x] * max
    
    for implementing max. Idea is to have openAccount select max accID from accounts and increment by 1.

#### Nested Subqueries 

[x] accomplished in bankStats menu

#### Also implement

[x] View for accounts minus balance

[x] Triggert to disallow non branch cities

[x] Stored function

And one more between

[x] Transaction processing

[] Prepared Statements

[] Stored Procedures


#### Written Report

*Name and brief description of your project, to include:*

– What problem does your proposed application solve?

– Specification of functional requirements. Operations to be supported.

Think about the kinds of queries that are likely for your application. Think
about ways in which data will be inserted, retrieved, or modified.

– User interface specification. For instance, if menu-based, menu and submenu options

*Database design documents including:*

– E-R model for your proposed database

– The tables that result from converting your E-R model to a relational

model. Use a schema diagram (similar to Figure 2.9 in your textbook) for
your database showing the tables that you will create. For each table list:

∗ all attributes and their types

∗ primary key and foreign key, if any

∗ not null specifications, if any

∗ any other integrity constraints you plan to incorporate
